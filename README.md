# E-commerce website built in React

This website displays some of my own astrophotos and expresses much of the functionality required of an e-commerce website. Users can adjust the number of an item in their cart using the plus and minus buttons, and they can check what is in their cart on the "Cart" page, where they can also adjust the quantity of an item they wish to purchase. If they adjust the quanity to zero, the item is automatically removed from the cart.
The frontend is built with React to dynamically render image cards according to product objects stored on Google Firebase. The user's cart is also stored on Firebase and is therefore persistent across visits to the page.
